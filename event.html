        <h3>
            The first annual “Miss Unlimited” pageant was held on May 10th, 2014 in Bannan Theater at Saint Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco.  
            We were honored to have on our panel the following people:
        </h3>
        <div class="profile">
            <h1>Greg Suhr</h1>
            <h2>Greg Suhr is a 32-year veteran of the San Francisco Police Department who was selected as San Francisco’s 42nd Chief of Police on April 27, 2011.  
            He firmly believes in the idea that the Police Department exists to serve the needs of our customers – those who live, work, 
            visit and play in our beautiful city. That belief serves as the foundation for many of the changes Chief Suhr has implemented this past year, 
            beginning with allowing any member of the public access to the Chief’s Office. It is not enough to talk about being open and accessible, 
            public officials must actually be open and accessible.  
            Chief Suhr was born and raised in this great city and feels that his success can be attributed to having caring adults 
            around to provide guidance and support when he needed it.  He believes that peace officers have a unique opportunity to 
            help children growing up in make the right choices. This year, the SFPD is dedicated to working closely with organizations 
            to provide our children with positive opportunities – and to encourage young adults to finish high school.  
            An integral part of all members’ duties is to help our children make the best decisions, both for their safety and for their future success.
            
            Chief Suhr’s guiding philosophy is, “I can’t believe that I am fortunate enough to be in a position to help people. 
            I can’t believe how lucky I am to be a cop in the best Police Department in the best City in the world. 
            I know that there is a kid out there that thinks that cops are heroes. I might be the first cop that he or she has ever seen. 
            I owe that kid my best. Every cop does.”

            She began doing her own forecasts as a teenager and would report the weather to friends for fun.

            In 2009, Christina finished a three-year program at Mississippi State University, achieving official Meteorological Certification.  
            After working at KHSL in Chico, KPSP in Palm Springs, and KERO in Bakersfield, 
            Christina has forecasted weather from Northern to Southern California and is excited to bring her experience and knowledge to the Bay Area.
